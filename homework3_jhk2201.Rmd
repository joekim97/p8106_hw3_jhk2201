### Problem 1 (Description of Instacart Data)

## How many aisles are there, and which aisles are the most items ordered from? 
```{r cars}

max(instacart$aisle_id)

instacart1 <- instacart %>%
  group_by(aisle) %>% 
  summarise(order_amount=n()) %>% 
  arrange(desc(order_amount)) 
```
There are 134 total aisles listed in the dataframe. The aisle with the most items
ordered from was fresh vegetables which had a count of 150609. 

```{r}
instacart2 <- filter(instacart1, order_amount>10000) %>% 
arrange(desc(order_amount)) 

ggplot(instacart2, aes(x = aisle, y = order_amount)) + geom_bar(stat="Identity") +
coord_flip() + labs(title = "Number of Items Ordered for Aisle Greater than 10,000")
              
```

```{r results='asis'}
instacart %>%
      filter(aisle %in% c("baking ingredients", "dog food care", "packaged vegetables fruits")) %>%
      group_by(aisle, product_name) %>%
      summarize(amount_product = n()) %>%
      arrange(aisle, desc(amount_product)) %>%
      filter(min_rank(desc(amount_product)) <4) %>%
      knitr::kable(digits = 1, caption = "The Top Three Most Popular Items Sold in ")

```
